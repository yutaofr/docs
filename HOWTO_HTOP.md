Use htop like a pro:
Htop has some very useful feature built-in to make one's life easier when working with system processes, here a list of feature that I find very helpful.

Scroll the process list horizontally and vertically using the arrow keys
Kill a process by pressing the F9' key
Renice a process by pressing the 'F7' or 'F8' key's
List open files used by a process by pressing the 'l' key
Display only processes of a single user by pressing the 'u' key
Display processes sorted by any htop column by pressing the 'F6' key
Display processes in a tree view by pressing the 'F5' key
